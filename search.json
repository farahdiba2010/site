    "text": "I combine my previous experience as an executive in the marketing field and my current academic expertise to deliberately amass a compilation of effective teaching techniques (e.g., case studies, simulation, gamification, and group work). My courses are well planned and in advance; nonetheless, I am flexible regarding the direction of the course. I continually challenge students to enhance their thoughts on various topics and encourage them to generate critical thinking about the issues dealt with in the class. This way, I model clear and critical thinking and expect it from the students.\nI teach students from all backgrounds and nationalities, such as Brazil, France, Italy, German, Belgian, Singapore, Colombia, Denmark, Spain, the USA, Portugal, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland, to say a few.\n\nExecutive Education (Teaching Assessment - average 3.5 of 4)\n\nDigital Marketing – Insper – (4h) – 2019 – current.\nDigital Marketing to CMO’s (8h)– 2022 – current.\n\n\n\nMBA (Teaching Assessment - average 3.7 of 4)\n\nMarketing Strategy Trends – Insper – (30h) – 2020 – current.\nDigital Marketing – Insper – (30h) – 2022 – current.\n\n\n\nUndergraduate (Teaching Evaluation - average 3.5 of 4)\n\nDigital Marketing – Insper –(80h) - 2018 - current.\nMarketing Metrics and Data Driven Marketing (Insper) (80h) 2019 – current.\nConscious Consumption and Marketing (40h) – 2022-2. - – current.\nConsumer Behavior (80h) _ 2021 -2\n\n\n\nOther teaching experience as invited lecturer\n\nMBA\n\nDigital Marketing – FGV-EAESP –(30h) – 2019 - current\n\n\n\nMBA, Executive Education, InCompany (Teaching Assessment - average 3.5 of 4)\n\nDigital Connection- InCompany for AMBEV – Insper (8h) 2021-1.\nDigital Marketing – InCompany for Siemens – FGV-EAESP (8h) 2019-2.\nDigital Marketing – Executive Education and MBA Programs – FGV-EAESP –(20h)–2019- current.\nBusiness Intelligence and Marketing – Executive Education Program - Saint Paul 2 x (8) – 2018-2; 2019-1.\nBusiness Intelligence and Marketing – executive MBA - Saint Paul Business School and New York Finance Institute -1x(12h) – 2018-2.\nBusiness Model Generation – executive MBA - FIA (Fundação Instituto de Administração Business School) –2 (4h) – 2012-1.\n\n\n\nUndergraduate\n\nDigital Marketing – FGV-EAESP –(40h) – 2019."

    "text": "This paper investigates how low-income consumers plan and manage their credit card spending and debt. We find that the poor are debt avert, and contrary to the traditional economic model, they use fewer installments to pay for their purchases. Co-Authors: Diogo Hildebrand (Baruch College) and Manuela Dantas (California State University). Status: studies completed, manuscript in progress. To be submitted to the Journal of Consumer Psychology (ABS4*), July 2023.\nThis paper investigates whether credit cards can be a tool to diminish financial constraints and promote inclusion. We analyze consumption patterns, installments and revolving credit usage, and payment behavior to see how these behaviors affect financial well-being. Co-Author: Danny Claro- Insper, and Nancy Wong, Wisconsin University. Status: ongoing study – variable transformation to run models and experiments. To be submitted to the Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, (ABS4*), September 2023.\nThis paper investigates how brands can engage with consumers via advanced technology (e.g., chatbots, AI) that positively affects consumer well-being. Co-Authors: Ricardo Limongi (UFG). Status: literature review."

    "text": "My research focuses broadly on the transformative consumer research and the better marketing for a better world agenda. I have a multidisciplinary approach with the goal of bridging marketing and consumer behavior. Specifically, I investigate particularly whether sustainable marketing practices affect the behavior of vulnerable consumers (e.g., financially vulnerable, low-income populations). I also investigate contextual, situational factors and psychological determinants that influence consumers’ finance decision making, social media usage, prosocial behavior, and how these behaviors impact individuals’ overall well-being. My research aims to produce insights that enrich theory as well as real-world decision-makers in the fields of consumer behavior, marketing, and public policy.
