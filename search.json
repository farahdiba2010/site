    "text": "My research focuses broadly on the transformative consumer research and the better marketing for a better world agenda. I have a multidisciplinary approach with the goal of bridging marketing and consumer behavior. Specifically, I investigate particularly whether sustainable marketing practices affect the behavior of vulnerable consumers (e.g., financially vulnerable, low-income populations). I also investigate contextual, situational factors and psychological determinants that influence consumers’ finance decision making, social media usage, prosocial behavior, and how these behaviors impact individuals’ overall well-being. My research aims to produce insights that enrich theory as well as real-world decision-makers in the fields of consumer behavior, marketing, and public policy. I am native in Portuguese, speak English fluently, knowledge of French and Spanish.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n     Email\n  \n  \n    \n     Resume\n  \n  \n    \n     LinkedIn"
