We investigate patterns of consumption, installment and revolving credit usage, and payment behavior, and how these behaviors affect their financial well-being. Co-Author: Danny Claro- Insper, and Nancy Wong, Wisconsin University. Status: ongoing study – variable transformation to run models and experiments. To be submitted to the Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, September 2023. Future research interests: investigate the harmful effects of social media social media and fake news in digital marketing. In summary, when it comes to research, my primary interests are in behavioral experiments and actual behavior analyses applied to the field of consumer behavior and marketing. I have pursued these interests to date by researching in an emerging economy context. In the immediate future, I would like to go further and investigate different contexts employing lab, lab-in-the-field experiments, and the analysis of datasets. In the long term, I see myself as a proficient teacher and research on marketing, transformative consumer behavior, prosocial behavior.\n\nCredit card spending and debt for low-income consumers.
